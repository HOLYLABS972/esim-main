## Still Not Working?

If Apple Pay still doesn't appear after checking all the above:

3. **Test with a minimal Stripe implementation** to isolate the issue
4. **Verify your app is not in TestFlight** (some Apple Pay features are limited in TestFlight)

## Quick Test Command

Run this in your Flutter app to get detailed Apple Pay status:

```dart
// Add this to your app for debugging
final status = await PaymentAbusePreventionService.getAbusePreventionStatus();
print('Payment Status: $status');

final applePayAvailable = await PaymentService().isApplePayAvailable();
print('Apple Pay Available: $applePayAvailable');
```
